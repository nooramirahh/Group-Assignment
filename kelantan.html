		<h2 class="titleText"><span>K</span>elantan <span>C</span>uisine</h2>
		<p>Kelantan cuisine is influenced quite a bit by the cuisine of Thailand and itâ€™s popular among people from Malaysia.
		A lot of the visitors which Kelantan receives come to the area in order to taste its recipes, which are not available
		in other areas. One of the things which their kitchen is based on is sugar and the result is that most dishes from the
		area are sweet. Another thing about it is the fact that it uses a lot of coconut milk, more than any other cuisine from
		Malaysia. Their curries are creamy and rich and their taste is based on the Thai cuisine. Below are the foods which are 
		based on the Kelantan cuisine and donâ€™t have influences from Thailand.</p>

				<h1>NASI KERABU</h1>
		<h3>Nasi kerabu is a Malay-style salad (a combination of local vegetables, herbs and fruits)
		served with rice thatâ€™s been dyed blue (naturally using bunga telang), 
		kerisik sambal ikan (fish floss with grated and sauteed coconut), budu (fermented fish sauce)
		which is a Kelantan specialty, boiled salted egg and fish crackers.
		At some places, the dish also comes with a choice of grilled beef or fried battered fish. 
		This combination of flavours will all create a uniquely beautiful taste in your mouth that you will never forget!
		Although nasi kerabu is available in both East Coast states, somehow itâ€™s relatively more popular in Kelantan.</h3>

  				<h1>NASI DAGANG</h1>
		<h3>Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, nasi dagang is available anywhere at any time in the East Coast ðŸ˜‹ 
		Thereâ€™s a slight difference between nasi dagang Terengganu and nasi dagang Kelantan! Nasi dagang is made up 
		of a mixture of white rice (in Terengganu) or brown rice (in Kelantan) and glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk, 
		shallots and fenugreek. In Terengganu, itâ€™s simply served with gulai ikan tongkol, which is a spicy red fish curry, 
		while sambal kelapa and boiled eggs are also served in Kelantan</h3>

				<h1>LAKSAM</h1>
		<h3>Made from rice flour, laksam is unlike any other noodles and more similar to laksa, except that itâ€™s been spread, 
		rolled and cut into bite size. Laksam is eaten with a gravy made from, you guessed it, fish meat and coconut milk mixed 
		with several other condiments. For spiciness, you can add some sambal to the dish. Like made other local dishes, 
		laksam is one of the staple breakfast menu in Kelantan.</h3>
