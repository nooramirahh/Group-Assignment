  			<h1>Nasi Kandar</h1>
			<h3>Nasi kandar is a Malaysian Indian, also known as Mamak, mixed rice dish, where an assortment of meats are added to a plate of white rice, 
			with various toppings to choose from including fried chicken, fish head curry, beef rendang, beansprouts, cabbage and popadoms.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the Malay language the word 'nasi' means rice, and there are other famous 'nasi' dishes in Malaysia such as 'nasi lemak' or 'nasi goreng'. The word 'kandar' refers to the bamboo pole which vendors (mostly Muslims from Northern India) would use to carry large containers of nasi kandar during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. According to local folklore the dish was very popular amongst the workers in the busy docks of Penang Island during British colonial times, many of whom themselves were immigrant workers from elsewhere in British Empire, particularly the Indian Sub-Continent. For this reason Nasi kandar is a dish which is closely associated with Penang, and some people believe that Penang is the only place where the dish is made correctly.
			<br>
			<br>Nasi kandar is a unique blend of Malay and Indian flavours and spices.</h3>

  		<h1>ASAM LAKSA</h1>
		<h3>Asam laksa is a traditional Malaysian fish-based sour noodle soup. It is the one of the numerous varieties of laksa, popular noodle soups widespread throughout Southeast Asia. The dish consists of rice noodles, shredded fish, and sliced vegetables, most commonly cucumber, onion, and lettuce.
		<br>
		<br>
		It has a distinctively tangy taste, which is attributed to tamarind, the sour ingredient generously used to spice the dish. The exact origin of the dish is unknown, but it is believed that it has originated in the coastal areas of Malaysia among the local fishermen who assembled the dish out of available ingredients.	
		<br>
		<br>
		Through history, the dish evolved into assam laksa that we know today. Regardless of its origin, nowadays it is a signature dish of the Malaysian region of Penang. It is one of the most famous street dishes found in the area, and a favorite with both locals and tourists. In Penang, street vendors prepare assam laksa from the early morning until late in the evening. Traditionally, the dish should be served with hae ko, a dark and rich Malaysian-style shrimp paste. </h3>
